                <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
                <p>Personal data is constantly generated. From mouse clicks to heart rate, our lives alongside technology is extensively documented. This kind of information can be a valuable tool for development and many companies are willing to pay big money for it. The issue right now is that the companies gathering your data, such as Facebook and Google, are selling your data to third parties without your knowledge or consent. Unbelievable, I know.  </p>
                <p>This is quite concerning as our data can majorly influence companies in their decision making, from targeted advertisement to political campaigns. 
                    </p>
                 <h5>However…</h5>
                 <p>The data industry is not ALL bad. In fact, your online data can <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/">help academic researchers learn more about humanity </a> or <a href="https://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Intelligent-Transit-Data-Improves-Transit-Efficiency.html">help cities build more efficient public transit.</a> Considering the data market is expected to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/big-data-market-2018-global-analysis-industry-demand-trends-size-opportunities-forecast-2023-2018-08-31"> reach $118 billion this year</a> we think it is only reasonable for individuals like you and me to be able to make some profit off the data we are so generously generating.  </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>The idea of a data marketplace is not new. There are currently a few applications and services that allow users to sell their data but there are flaws to them. Many don’t give users full transparency on how their data is being used once sold. The services that do give users access as to how their data is being used offer little to no compensation in exchange for the data.

                <h4>Offers</h4>
                <p>In the initial conceptualization of the offers page/functionality, we had envisioned quick actions for the user to be able to accept or decline an offer directly from the dashboard without having to open a separate panel. However, this encourages the user to potentially consent to an offer while having read minimal information about what they are giving up. This goes against our business’ core objectives of offering complete transparency to the users.</p>
                <p>Reviewing this, we changed the user interaction design for this component to automatically open a pop-up window with clearly stated details about the offer. From this pop-up, users can then choose to accept or decline the offer. </p>
               <p>We have applied this to both the quick access /recent offers in the dashboards as well as the offers page.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h4>What we learned</h4>
            <p>The hardest part of designing this application was probably understanding the problem itself. Understanding the underlying pain points behind the frustrations of users towards the data industry and effectively addressing these in our design required a lot of communication with our user base. Analysing our research, we were able to narrow down what was keeping the users skeptical about selling their data. Keeping in mind all we had learnt along the way, we designed a web application that is engaging, inspires trust and remains transparent with information.</p>
